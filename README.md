# web-scraping-challenge

The scraper_mars.py file uses the Attribute "headless = True" so it doesn't show the browser window, simulating a final version product for an user which doesn't know where the data is gotten from.

On the other side, the Jupyter notebook has the headless property set to False, so it can be seen how the browser is launched, the webpages are visited and the data is brought.
